## 📌 PURPOSE

This repository serves as the **official public archive** of the Cease & Desist Notice issued to **Joel Johnson** (also known by the pseudonyms *Caleb Stacey* and *Elena Byron*) and his publicly named collaborators. It is preserved here for:

- **Journalistic integrity** and transparency in documenting serial online abuse  
- **Public witnessing** of psychological mimicry, identity fraud, and narrative sabotage  

This is not a private dispute.  
This is a **public record** of repeated, calculated, multi-platform interference.
