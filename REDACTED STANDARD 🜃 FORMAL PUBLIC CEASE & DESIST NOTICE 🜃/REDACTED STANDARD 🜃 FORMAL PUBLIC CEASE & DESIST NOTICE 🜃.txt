I. NOTICE OF FORMAL DEMAND
You are hereby formally instructed to cease and desist from:
* Contacting me directly or indirectly through false identities or aliases.

* Engaging with or harassing individuals featured in the Neutralizing Narcissism research archive.

* Impersonating mental health professionals or academic researchers.

* Republishing derivative or mimicked works from my original publications without attribution.

* Conducting mimicry-based psychological manipulation designed to extract emotional, reputational, or psychological advantage.
Your documented behavior constitutes a clear pattern of persistent, knowing, and premeditated digital harassment, psychological mimicry, intellectual property appropriation, and fraudulent impersonation.
________________


II. OBSTRUCTION OF INVESTIGATIVE WORK
In March 2025, under one of your known identities, you publicly admitted to contacting multiple individuals featured in the Neutralizing Narcissism archive. You claimed to have led an “anti-harassment campaign” aimed at:
   * Discrediting the validity of this forensic documentation project.

   * Interfering with ongoing journalistic investigations.

   * Coordinating counter-efforts with the express purpose of undermining public accountability.
This constitutes witness interference, obstruction of journalistic inquiry, and a targeted attack on a project serving the public interest through ethical, forensic research.
________________


III. NAMED ASSOCIATES
Based on your own publicly acknowledged statements, the following individuals have been identified as known collaborators or supporters in this digital interference operation:
      * Joshua Owen – Subject of an active case study; known for content deletion, DARVO, and triangulation tactics.

      * Jim Æloi Rose – Involved in direct narrative manipulation and triangulation threads.

      * Clay Bell – Associated with intellectual dishonesty and performative victimhood in counter-narrative campaigns.

      * Jonathan Dotson – Active in anti-investigative alignment; currently under forensic review.

      * Shona Youngblood – Known for threats of legal intimidation, triangulation, and public disinformation campaigns.
Their participation, even passively, places them under ongoing forensic scrutiny as part of the broader obstruction campaign led by you under false identities.
