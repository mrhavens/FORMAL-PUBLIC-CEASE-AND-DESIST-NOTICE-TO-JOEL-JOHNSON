🜃 FORMAL PUBLIC CEASE & DESIST NOTICE 🜃
Against the Entity Operating Under the Aliases “Caleb Stacey” and “Elena Byron”
(And Other Associated Interference Actors)
Date: July 9, 2025
From: Mark Randall Havens, Investigative Researcher and Founder of Neutralizing Narcissism
To: The entity or entities operating under the online identities "Caleb Stacey" and "Elena Byron"
________________


I. NOTICE OF FORMAL DEMAND
This is a public and legally coherent cease and desist declaration directed at an individual (or coordinated group) who has used multiple false identities to:
* Contact me through fabricated personas.

* Engage in mimicry-based psychological manipulation.

* Interfere with ongoing journalistic investigations.

* Republish derivative or restructured forms of my original work without attribution.

* Falsely imply academic or clinical credentials.

You are now under formal public notice to immediately cease and desist from all further contact, replication, mimicry, manipulation, or interference.
________________


II. DOCUMENTED PATTERN OF HARASSMENT
The entity behind these aliases has exhibited a recurring pattern of behavior involving:
   * The creation of strategically timed pseudonymous accounts designed to mimic the rhetorical, philosophical, or scientific frameworks of my work.

   * Publishing highly compressed, precision-tailored articles constructed using my intellectual corpus, often framed to provoke engagement or manipulation.

   * Establishing false emotional or epistemic rapport through the imitation of sacred motifs, including symbolic language from my published essays and dialogue systems.

   * Engaging in unauthorized impersonation, including falsely presenting as a clinical psychologist, researcher, or spiritual scholar.

This behavior constitutes a deliberate and premeditated effort to intrude upon, exploit, and sabotage my research.
________________


III. OBSTRUCTION OF INVESTIGATION
In March 2025, the individual operating under these aliases publicly claimed to have initiated an “anti-harassment campaign” which included contacting subjects featured in my investigative series, Neutralizing Narcissism.
This act constitutes deliberate obstruction, witness interference, and attempted narrative sabotage. It is a violation not only of journalistic integrity but of public trust and digital safety.
________________


IV. KNOWN ASSOCIATES (REDACTED)
While this version omits direct naming for legal and policy compliance on this platform, it is important to acknowledge that this individual has publicly indicated collaboration with others who are also subjects of my research archive. These connections, along with detailed evidence and forensic analysis, are published and available in the unabridged version of this document (linked below).
________________


V. LEGAL FRAMEWORK
This pattern of behavior may fall under the following violations, subject to further review by civil and criminal investigators:
      * False impersonation of professional status

      * Cyber harassment

      * Obstruction of journalistic inquiry

      * Coordinated psychological targeting via sockpuppetry

      * Violation of platform integrity and abuse reporting systems

These activities may be prosecutable under multiple jurisdictions depending on the evolving nature of this case. Additional context and jurisdictional mappings are provided in the full legal archive.
________________


VI. PUBLIC RECORD, PUBLIC NOTICE
This cease & desist is now part of the permanent public record and has been:
         * Archived in immutable timestamped form via Web3 and forensic repositories.

         * Cross-published on legally shielded platforms including Substack, GitField, and Mirror.

         * Forwarded to counsel and legal observers monitoring the situation.

If you are reading this and recognize yourself or your collaborators in these patterns, know this:
You are not anonymous.
You are not untouchable.
You are not original.
And you are now documented.
________________


VII. CLOSING DECLARATION
The entity behind these accounts is free to seek healing through transparency, admission, and withdrawal. But the mimicry ends here.
No more stolen masks.
No more false mirrors.
No more proximity to truth without coherence.
Any continued interference, evasion, or misrepresentation will result in direct legal action and further exposure through journalistic means, platform moderation, and public accountability initiatives.
